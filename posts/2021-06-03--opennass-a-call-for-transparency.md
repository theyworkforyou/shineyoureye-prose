In 2013, EiE Nigeria started the #OpenNASS campaign that demands an open, transparent and accountable National Assembly. The National Assembly wants to check the excesses of others, yet they do not want to be checked by others.

EiE and partners have continually engaged the National Assembly for their lack of transparency and accountability because a strong and accessible legislature is critical to any democracy.

Good governance in Nigeria cannot be achieved without the National Assembly stepping up to its full responsibilities. The National Assembly is responsible for appropriation of budgets; making laws; proper representation of their constituencies; oversight on the executive arm to ensure delivery of project monies appropriated; and consent to high-level appointments.

Our demands with the #OpenNASS campaign is very clear. Make public details of the National Assembly budget, replace voice voting with electronic voting systems, so citizens can track their representatives, maintain a functional website and make public the attendance record at plenary. 

Although in 2017, the breakdown of the National Assembly’s ₦125bn budget was made public for the 1st time in 7 years as a result of the #OpenNASS campaign, they have refused to make other budget details Public except for a few details they shared on the 2019 NASS Budget.

In 2019, the House of Representatives promised to adopt electronic attendance register & electronic voting on bills and legislation but this has not been implemented. However, it is not enough to adopt electronic voting and electronic attendance register, the results must be made public. The world is going digital and government institutions must also embrace technology for efficiency.

We are in a digital age, where technology is being implored to make governance easy and accessible to citizens. One of the basic ways is having a functional website. It is unfortunate that despite the N134 billion allocated to the National Assembly in 2021, there is no functional website. For the past 2 months, the National Assembly website has been down without any show of concern to make it live. Why is it difficult to fix a website?

Engage Senate President, Ahmad Lawan and the Speaker, House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila to do their job and take responsibility. We demand a website that contains up to date information of members, attendance records at the plenary, budget breakdown and status of constituency projects nominated by representatives.

We cannot relent in our effort to fix Nigeria. Engage your elected officials and ask questions. The time has come to occupy your Office of the Citizen.

The race to the better Nigeria we want is a marathon, not a sprint. Stay demanding!
