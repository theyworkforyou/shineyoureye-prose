title: Your Dreams Are Still Valid!
---
As a child raised in Nigeria in the early ‘80s, I had lots of dreams. One of them was to become President. I fondly recall evening folktales and stories with peers. It was a time to share dreams and aspirations. Everyone was eager to grow up and become a great person in society.
 
Unfortunately, decades after, many of us are still dreaming, wondering to ourselves, “Where is the future we dreamt of, yesterday?” They always told us, “You are the leaders of tomorrow", yet this tomorrow never comes! 
 
This political trickery slowly unfolded when I became a youth and earned my right to vote. I then realized that the bogus promises of our leaders and all those phony state campaigns promising a better life, free housing for all, etc., were only gimmicks to get into office. These leaders had nothing to offer but a lot to loot. 
 
The saddest part was the people. 
 
At the mercy of shady politicians, the masses seemed too willing to believe and cut mindless deals with electoral candidates and the incumbent officials. Many were and are still willing to vote for bags of rice and canned tomato puree at the expense of what happens to them in the next four years. What an opportunity cost so easily dismissed! 
 
However, as we all know, we cannot eat our cakes and have them. This is a major reason political office holders do not believe in accountability. For how can we seek accountability having sold our votes and the future of the coming generations for rice and branded wrappers? 

Omo! This leaders-of-tomorrow scam, e no start today o. If you think this is a lie, please ask your senior aunties and uncles. They were also “leaders” of a tomorrow that is still yet to come. Haaba!  Our mumu done do o! The future is now, and it's in our hands.  

The truth is nothing has really changed positively since my childhood. Although like other Nigerians, I sometimes feel helpless in a system rife with corruption at literally every level, I still believe in the Nigeria of my dreams albeit, there is so much to be done to achieve those big dreams. 

One such critical task ahead is the decision to vote. We cannot wish true change into existence, but we can vote towards the change we desire. You cannot complain about the state of the country when you fail to exercise your power to vote. The future of our dear country is upon us all and we cannot afford to fail the next generation. 

What Nigeria do you want to see 10 years from now? The work starts today! Remember the saying: "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a step"? 
The journey to the ideal Nigeria where everything works right is a marathon, not a sprint. You and I have a huge role to play in fixing our dear country.

So, if you do not have a voter’s card, the opportunity is here, register in the ongoing Continuous Voters Registration (CVR) and get ready to make a difference.  
Your dreams are still valid! So is mine — a President in the making!! 

Dear active citizens, a new Nigeria is emerging, with leaders who have love and empathy for the country—those who will redefine good governance and create legacies that will transcend generations. 

Do not forget, time is of the essence. The 2023 general elections are approaching, get ready with your voter’s card and let's make the change together.  
Your vote counts only when you vote. We move!
