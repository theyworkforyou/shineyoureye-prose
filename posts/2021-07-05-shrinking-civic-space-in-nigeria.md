title: Shrinking Civic Space In Nigeria
---
The civic space in Nigeria is shrinking by the day, with different government policies aimed at hindering the free participation and communication of its citizenry. The bedrock of any democratic society is in how its civic space is managed and the ability of citizens to organise, participate, and influence political and social structure without their rights being violated for speaking up. Freedom of expression is not a luxury in any democratic society, it is a right. However, the reverse is the case in Nigeria from the recent happenings. All we have seen from this administration is a reactive and insensitive action aimed at shrinking our civic space and human rights, for merely demanding accountability. Everyday in Nigeria, the rights of citizens are being violated, the same rights they swore to protect when they were voted into office.

As far as I can remember, Nigeria is still a democratic country guided by a constitution. Chapter 4 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), clearly guarantees civil and political rights, including the right to life, personal liberty, fair trial, freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. Yet, President Buhari’s administration is committed to silencing dissenting voices under different covers.

Active Citizens, it is very glaring that freedom of speech is under attack in Nigeria and it's time to speak up against this attempt to deprive us of our fundamental right to express ourselves. Already, there have been several attempts to silence the voice of Nigerians - #NGOBill, #SocialMediaBill, #HateSpeechBill, #NBCRules, and recently,  the #TwitterBan.

In a world where countries are leveraging technology and social media to harness resources for development, banning Twitter means one thing - they fear its power in organising and holding the government accountable. 

The ECOWAS Court ruled on June 22, 2021 directing the federal government to lift the ban on Twitter, yet the federal government insist on #TwitterBan. President Buhari’s administration has repeatedly flouted court orders and directives despite his administration’s promise to uphold the rule of law. What is happening in this country? How did we get here? Where is the judiciary in all this brouhaha? Are they not upholders of the law? We call on the judiciary to assume its responsibilities and protect the constitution which guarantees our human rights as citizens of Nigeria.

Remember that this ban is not only a threat to our freedom of expression as citizens, it also has grave consequences on the Nigerian economy. According to a report by NetBlocks, a global internet monitor, Nigeria loses approximately $250,000 for each hour that the suspension is in place. This is so because, SMEs, freelancers, & startups who built their businesses around the platform are all affected by this ban.

Active Citizens, how many more repressive policies must this government make before we speak up? We must stay demanding on the government to respect the constitution and the fundamental human rights of citizens. We can as #OnePerson take an action by calling and engaging our representatives in the different constituencies to demand that they protect our rights and freedom by ensuring the Twitter ban and other bills that infringe on our human rights are stepped down.  Remember the journey to fixing Nigeria is a marathon and not a sprint. 

Your voice is your power! Use it judiciously!!
