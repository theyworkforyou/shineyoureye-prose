title: Anybody Can Be A Watchdog
---
An author or a publisher who fact-checks and interviews individuals and organizations with the aim of verifying the validity of their actions and statements is a Watchdog. A Watchdog is an individual or group of individuals – usually for profit – that keep an eye on a particular entity or a particular element of community concern, individuals, policies, or simply warns members of a community of potential or actual problems.

Watchdogs expose and address issues by gathering and publicizing relevant information on the area in focus like healthcare, economy, security, environment, community, quality of life, and public interest.

While some watchdog individuals or organizations simply seek to draw attention to issues, others use their information actively to solve problems by tackling them and initiating lawsuits against individuals and institutions that are threats to the public interest. Simply put, the purpose of watchdogs is to protect.

For watchdogs, purpose differs. While some concentrate solely on that function, many have other purposes as well, and include the watchdog role as only one of the things they do. The watchdog role overlaps with that of the advocate, but the thrust of most advocacy is the advancement of a cause or the improvement of conditions for a particular population or geographic area. 

From the person who attends and takes notes at townhall meetings to not for profit organizations that have a presence at civic society meetings, watchdogs monitor entities to make sure that their operations and actions don’t cause harm or conflict with the public interest.  When they find that conflict, they may act as whistle-blowers, exposing illegal or other negative actions or practices to public view with hopes that exposure will bring about the appropriate measures as a result of a public outcry. Alternatively, some watchdogs may lobby, engage in direct action of some sort, or go to court to stop actions or reverse conditions that endanger or otherwise harm the public.

There are watchdogs that address consumer issues, health, the qualifications of members of various professions, fairness in the media, pollution, etc. In fact, anybody can be a watchdog on the local, state, federal, or international levels; you might monitor almost any issue; and you might direct your attention to almost any individual, group, organization, sector (business, government, education, etc.), or institution that has some effect on the physical, social, economic, or political well-being of the community, the state, the nation, or the world.

Organizations like BudgIT, EiE Nigeria and SERAP keep tabs on the ethics and practices of the Nigerian government. No doubt, watchdogs play a very critical role in the political sphere in Nigeria. Imagine a Nigeria where there is no CSO to check the excesses of elected officials...that would be a lawless country, considering the kind of leaders that we have.

For entities that do so much yet receive little or no accolades, watchdogs continue to do their bit in ensuring functional and fair communities.
