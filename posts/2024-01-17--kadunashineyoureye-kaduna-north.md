In the heart of Kaduna State, a transformative project named "Kaduna, Shine Your Eye" took root, fueling government accountability and community engagement in monitoring Zonal Intervention Projects. 
This project championed by Enough is Enough Nigeria (EiE Nigeria) and her Kaduna State Partners - Legal Awareness for Nigerian Women (LANW) and Human Rights Monitor (HRM) was supported by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) Nigeria and The Nigerian Civil Society Situation Room. 
In November and December 2023,  residents in each of the 10 LGAs were brought together; including religious and traditional leaders, youth representatives, women leaders, persons with disability and Community Development Charter Champions.

### **Kudan LGA**
 
The first meeting was held at Model Primary School and the second at Model Secondary School with a combined attendance of 55 persons. The LGA Champion, Muhammad Auwal Idris, facilitated the discussions, emphasizing citizen sensitization, education, and the identification of community priorities. 
During the meeting, community members passionately voiced their needs, spanning from road construction and school building to addressing insecurity through the construction of a police division and advocating for skill acquisition centers.
At the second meeting, the citizens were sensitized on the roles and responsibilities of elected officials from the LGA chairman to senators, with their names and political parties; and the power citizens have to recall bad leaders.
The participants were also taken through a list of Zonal Intervention Projects from 2020 to 2023. While some of the participants were able to identify some of the projects, the facilitator asked them to go to the field or where the projects are situated to get evidence and report back by the next meeting.

### **Kubau LGA**
The two meetings took place at the palace of the Village Head in Kubau with a total of 52 persons in attendance. The Community Champion, Bashir facilitated the first meeting and kicked off by educating the participants on the three arms of government and their functions, focusing on the legislative arm. He also stated the lack of effectiveness on the part of the elected representatives in Kubau LGA in carrying out previous ZIPs. He pleaded with all in attendance to give their full support of the project activities and their benefit to the development of the LGA.
The Village Head registered his displeasure with the low turnout of women at the meeting and encouraged more women to take part in the subsequent meetings and contribute to governance conversations in Kubau.
The second meeting recorded more females in attendance and captured discussions around key legislation issues the Shine Your Eye project aims to address, the need for accountability and the role of stakeholders in the community to spearhead the demand for accountability from legislators.

### **Makarfi LGA**
The town hall meetings were held at the Palace of the District Head of Gubuchi with a total of 71 persons in attendance during both meetings. Suleiman Bello, the LGA Champion welcomed participants, and Mal. Mustapha Abubakar expressed gratitude for selecting Makarfi for the program. The project supervisor for LANW,  Femi Johnson, highlighted the importance of tracking and monitoring zonal intervention projects.
During the session, participants actively identified pressing community needs, focusing on critical areas such as road construction, healthcare, and education which shed light on the specific challenges and priorities within the LGA.
At the second meeting, the citizens were enlightened on the roles of the LGA Chairman and representatives, sources of revenue for local governments and how citizens can engage them effectively. Citizens were also encouraged to ensure that government projects within their community were maintained and not vandalized or destroyed.
On a final note, the facilitator listed the ZIPs from 2020 to 2023 and urged them to track ZIPs within their local government and report back by the next town hall meeting in January.

### **Sabon Gari LGA**
The first and second town hall meetings were held at the Sabon Gari Local Government Secretariat with 49 people in attendance cumulatively. Umaru Hussaini, the LGA Champion, led the discussion on the significance of tracking and monitoring projects.
During the session, citizens collaboratively identified pressing community needs, spanning from essential infrastructure development to the improvement of educational facilities. 
At the second meeting, a brief recap of the first meeting was done by the Community Champion. Afterward, an exercise was done to determine the level to which the citizens knew their elected representatives. The list of ZIPs in LGA was shared with the citizens with a request for them to investigate the projects and report back by the next meeting.
The discussion resulted in the correction of the assumptions of citizens that zonal intervention projects are personal projects of the senators as a reward to the community that voted for them.

### **Zaria LGA**
The two town hall meetings had 66 persons in attendance, combined. The Community Champion, Salim Ibrahim started the first meeting by highlighting the meeting goals. He detailed the roles of legislators and executives and highlighted citizens' rights, often overlooked as privileges. He stressed the need for community leaders' full commitment for the success of the project while announcing that there would be subsequent town hall meetings. 
At the second meeting, the objective of the project was reemphasized and the discussion progressed to past ZIPs listed in the 2023 budget and their status, and present ones yet to be commenced or concluded. The meeting ended with the participants expressing their strengthened resolve to be involved in democracy and governance.
