Nigeria faces significant challenges in its governance landscape, and recent insights into the National Assembly's website have shed light on deep-rooted systemic issues. An in-depth examination revealed concerns about the state of the website, echoing sentiments shared by numerous citizens. 

The National Assembly's website, designed as a comprehensive repository of legislative activities, exhibits inefficiencies and outdated content. Inadequate entries, absent documents, and discrepancies infringing upon the Freedom of Information Act underscore the significant shortcomings in ensuring accessible and transparent governance.

The National Assembly's website reveals major shortcomings. It only contains 823 entries from 1999 to 2018, with missing dates and inaccessible documents. The most recent Hansard entry dates back to May 31, 2018, under the 9th Assembly. The Order Papers were last updated in March 2020, and the Bills tracker page lacks proper dates for its content and was updated last in 2022, making it challenging to access crucial legislative information.

In contrast to the Nigerian National Assembly website, the South African National Assembly website shines through its dedication to providing citizens with up-to-date information on recent bills, legislative records, and comprehensive details about elected officials' activities, including the 2023 updates. This commitment ensures easy access to the latest legislative developments and initiatives, significantly enhancing transparency and accountability within the country's governance. The website is consistently updating its content and ensuring that information is easily accessible, setting a great example for effective public information dissemination.


Amid the challenges within Nigeria's governance, there's a glimmer of hope presented by Shine Your Eye, an initiative by EiE.  This initiative stands out as a beacon for fostering accountable and transparent governance. The website serves as a platform empowering citizens with tools to actively engage, monitor elected officials, and demand accountability, contributing to a more transparent and responsible political landscape.

Shine Your Eye platform seeks to assist users in finding their elected officials at various tiers of government, providing contact details and comprehensive profiles that include educational backgrounds, experiences, social media connections, phone numbers, and email addresses.



The platform aims to enhance accountability in governance, enabling easier connections between Nigerians and their elected officials. Through the website, significant strides have been made in empowering citizens to access crucial information about their elected representatives. 



However, it's important to acknowledge the challenges encountered during this process. Obtaining complete and accurate information about officials proved challenging, primarily due to the outdated state of the National Assembly's website. Since the NASS website is meant to be a primary reference, the lack of updates and accessible data compelled EiE Nigeria to seek information from volunteers across Nigeria to source accurate information. Crowdsourcing has also been used as a strategy to gather up-to-date information, reflecting the collective effort required to bridge information gaps.  Despite these obstacles, the initiative remains committed to its goal of fostering a more transparent political landscape.

Looking ahead, Shine Your Eye aspires to overcome these challenges and further enhance its impact. The long-term vision includes not only addressing immediate information gaps but also advocating for structural reforms within institutions like the National Assembly. By continuing to empower citizens with accurate and up-to-date information, Shine Your Eye aims to foster a culture of accountability, ultimately contributing to a more open and better governance in Nigeria.

The acknowledgment of deficiencies in Nigeria's public service rightly highlights the necessity for structural reform. The outdated National Assembly website stands as a visible indicator of a more extensive administrative problem. 

In conclusion, the urgency for accessible and transparent governance echoes loudly within Nigeria's administrative sphere. The need for structural reform is undeniable. Letâ€™s collectively, actively engage, and contribute to the shaping of a more open and responsible governance landscape.
