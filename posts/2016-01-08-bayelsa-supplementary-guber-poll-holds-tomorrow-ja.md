The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) will tomorrow, Saturday (January 9), conduct supplementary elections in Southern Ijaw LGA and some polling units in three other LGAs (Nembe, Ogbia and Brass) where elections were cancelled.

A new date was fixed for the polls after a consultative meeting with leaders of political parties who fielded candidates in the December 5, 2015 Bayelsa governorship election and the candidates who contested the election at the INEC headquarters.

The INEC had on Monday, December 7, 2015 cancelled the election in Southern Ijaw, following widespread violence, ballot box snatching and abduction of electoral officials.

Since the cancellation of the elections, tension has remained high in Bayelsa, with supporters of the two main contenders engaging in verbal war and reports of residents fleeing Southern Ijaw local government area

Responsively, the federal government has deployed hundreds of soldiers, policemen and other security agents to ensure safety of the electorate. Southern Ijaw has a total of 120,827 registered voters, which makes up 18% of Bayelsa state’s 663,639 total registered voters.

From the first ballot, the incumbent Governor and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Henry Seriake Dickson leads former Governor and candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Timipre Sylva, based on election results declared so far.

Sylva won only in his locality –Brass, while Dickson won in 4 of 5 local government areas announced, garnering a total of 81,929 votes against Sylva’s of 56,514 votes. 25,415 votes currently separate the 2 aspirants as they head on to tomorrow’s rerun both aiming to garner needed votes from the Southern Ijaw voters.
