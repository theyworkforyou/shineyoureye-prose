Ladies and Gentlemen of the Nigerian Federation, the much talked about election is over. Or not quite, since there are a number of pending cases in court. According to the Nigerian Constitution, elected winners will take the oath of office despite ongoing court proceedings (in the election petition tribunal) initiated by dissatisfied parties regarding the elections.

**What next?**
It is time for US to start holding our leaders accountable. In fact, it is a MUST.

How best to do that than to Shine Your Eye. The Office of the Citizen and by proxy, the OOTC CHATBOT is the best way to do that. The CHATBOT is an extension of the Shine Your Eye initiative aimed at ensuring that everyone becomes an active citizen, assumes the office of the citizen by demanding accountability and good governance from elected leaders, and becomes familiar with their representatives at all tiers of government.

Enough is Enough (EiE Nigeria) earlier launched the Whatsapp-enabled bot referred to as the OOTC CHATBOT to further strengthen the Office of the Citizen. 

This initiative was initially a web and SMS platform, but has transitioned to replace SMS and provide easier access, wider reach and seamless interaction - on the premise that Whatsapp is more commonly used amongst next generation voters (18+ and upwards).

A key functionality of this platform is its assistance to Citizens in knowing their elected representatives by providing access to their profiles and contact information. The available information include educational background, experience, social media accounts, phone numebres and email addresses.
With this initiative, citizens can interact with their elected representatives, schedule meetings to discuss concerns and solutions for the overall benefit of the community.

However, all hands need to be on deck to get the Nigeria we deserve. We are currently compiling information on all the elected candidates nationwide, so, if you know any of the representatives or can provide us with the necessary information about them, please send us a message on any of our social media platforms or email [syeinfo@eienigeria.org](mailto:syeinfo@eienigeria.org).  

To get started with the Chatbot send “hello”  via Whatsapp to [017006381](tel:017006381) or visit [https://eieng.co/OOTCbot](https://eieng.co/OOTCbot). 
It’s time to #ShineYourEye!
