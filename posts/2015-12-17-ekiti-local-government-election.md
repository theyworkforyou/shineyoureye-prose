The first of local government [elections](http://www.shineyoureye.org/info/local-government-elections "LG Polls") in this new political dispensation will take place tomorrow in Ekiti State. 

However, the timing is precisely 14 months after the governor was sworn-in.

Initially, the All Progressives Congress (APC) filed a case in the High Court in a bid to stop the conduct of the local government election, based on the allegation that the chairman of the State Independent Electoral Commission (SIEC) is a card carrying member of the governor’s party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).

The suit was adjudged baseless and without merit. 

As the APC decides to appeal the judgement, 5 political parties will participate in the polls tomorrow – 

- Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)

- African People’s Alliance (APA)

- KOWA Party

- United Progress Party (UPP)

- People’s Party of Nigeria (PPN)

In Ekiti? You can observe and let us know about the electoral process.
