Nigeria has, in recent times more than ever, recorded a good number of terrorist attacks, insurgency and kidnapping, the most alarming being kidnapping. The average Nigerian has refused to travel by road because our roads have become dens for robbers and kidnappers. That's how bad things have become. The question then is, what becomes of those who cannot afford flights?

Another worrying aspect is the brazenness at which these kidnappers carry out operations. In the space of three months, three kidnappings were recorded. Gunmen had stormed Government Girls Secondary School, Jangebe, Zamfara State. Another kidnapping took place at Government Science College, Kagara, Niger State, 42 people including 27 students were kidnapped. Lest I forget, over 300 pupils were also kidnapped from a boys' secondary boarding school on the outskirts of Kankara, Katsina State.

If there's one thing these kidnappings indicate, it is the total failure on the part of the government to fulfil its obligations of protecting lives and properties. It also seems as though these mass abductions of children were sure ways of applying pressure on authorities, including asking for ransom, although the authorities always deny paying.

This has become a lucrative business for kidnappers and the financial and emotional implications for victims and their families is a great one. The government does not appear to have a strategy for stopping these incidents from happening and we are getting the "every man for himself" vibe...after all, most Nigerian politicians do not have their families here, so, they have nothing to lose. They are wrapped up away in their safe bubbles, sneaking a peek at the chaos that has become of Nigeria. In many parts of the country, kidnapping appears to have become a business, especially for otherwise unemployed youth.

SB Morgen, a Nigerian consulting firm, using data gathered from a variety of open sources, including the Council’s Nigeria Security Tracker, shows that, over time, the pool of potential victims has greatly expanded. Now, victims are often poor villagers, sometimes kidnapped indiscriminately, a departure from the targeted kidnapping of wealthy people. They struggle to pay ransoms quickly because of their relative poverty, and victims are much more likely to be killed.

Anyway, less of whining and faux promises, more of actions.

The government needs to step up. You cannot be saddle with such great responsibility and still be playing opposition. The election period has long been over. You're in power now. What are the plans and/or way forward? We cannot continue this way.
