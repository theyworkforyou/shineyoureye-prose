Let’s tell ourselves the truth.
 
Our struggles are real. For decades, citizens have hoped for a system that works - good governance, accountable leadership, transparency, security, and other basic requirements of a functioning federal system. 
 
So many questions begging for answers in a country that is blessed with human and natural resources!  When will it happen? Who will make it happen? Who would have thought that with the abundant resources in this country, we would be where we are today. It is so disheartening.
 
Well, let me not bore you with the long sermon. The crux of the matter is that the government must start making deliberate attempts to fix Nigeria. Haba! It is not too much to ask, for a 61-year-old country. It is time for the 3 arms of government to actively play their roles in the interest of the nation without hidden political agendas. 
 
Policies and laws should be in the interest of the country. It is not rocket science to make Nigeria work if there is a will to do so.
 
Citizens are tired of the numerous inimical  policies that hinder growth and economic advancement. Is it the Twitter ban that has negatively impacted the growth of micro, small and medium-scale enterprises? What about the current gbas gbos received by the electoral bill on the proposed electronic transmission of election results by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)? Sigh! 
 
Shouldn't the demand for free and credible elections be sacrosanct? The power to determine voting and transmission of results should be at the discretion of INEC without interference from any agency or institution. It is not complicated.
 
Active citizens, I understand how difficult it is to cope with all these happenings, but I must remind you that we have a powerful tool in our  hands to make things work! Get your Permanent Voter Card (PVC) and be ready to vote for credible leaders that will pilot the affairs of our dear country. If you have not registered to get a voters card, remember that the second phase of the continuous voter registration process will start on October 4th. 
 
Mobilize your friends and acquaintances to get registered. Don’t miss the opportunity to make a change.
 
This is the time we all have been waiting for! Make it count.
 
I am really looking forward to sharing the success stories of Nigeria with you soonest. Though it may be a roller coaster ride,  we shall surely get there.
