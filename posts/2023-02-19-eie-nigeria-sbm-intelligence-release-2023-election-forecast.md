> "The right to vote is the cornerstone of a free and democratic society"
 - Kofi Annan (former Secretary-General of the United Nations)

As a leading civil society organisation, Enough is Enough (EiE) Nigeria believes in the importance of promoting democracy and the free, fair and credible elections that are at its foundation. As a result, EiE Nigeria commissioned SBM Intelligence to do a nationwide survey of likely voters on salient issues regarding the 2023 elections, featuring 11,534 respondents with 78% engaged face-to-face and 22% via telephone.

For the first time since the era of parliamentary democracy in the 1960s, there are three competitive political blocs distributed along the old eastern, northern and western regional divides with a couple of swing states where the presidential candidates must compete for absolute votes and vote share. Hence the survey results did not provide us with a clear frontrunner. 

The data suggest that the Labour Party (LP)’s Peter Obi and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)’s Atiku Abubakar could garner enough votes over a sufficient number of states across four of the country’s six geopolitical zones to meet the constitutional requirement of scoring 25% in at least 24 states. This outcome, however, is complicated by the fact that the All Progressives Congress (APC)’s Bola Ahmed Tinubu is likely to do well in two of the country’s biggest voting states—Kano and Lagos—and the heavily populated south-west and north-west states, thereby winning the popular vote, although reaching the 50%+1 bar may be a stretch too far. 

The New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP)’s Rabiu Kwankwaso may garner sufficient votes in Kano and some states in the north-central and north-west geopolitical zones to complicate the political math for other candidates on both the popular vote and the “Road to 24” measures.  The forecast also predicts which party is most likely to get the most seats in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. Both poll predictions may come as a surprise to many! Furthermore, most citizens are focused on the presidential election with a 100% response rate. Only 35% responded to questions about the governorship elections, while the interest in state legislature elections was 14%. 

More details on each candidate’s chances of winning; the impact of ethnicity & religion; and issues of interest, are available in the full report available on both websites - [www.eie.ng](https://eie.ng "EiE Website") and [www.sbmintel.com](https://sbmintel.com "SBM Intelligence website").

God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria!
