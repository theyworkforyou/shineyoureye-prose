In the heart of Kaduna State, a transformative project named "Kaduna, Shine Your Eye" took root, championed by Enough is Enough Nigeria (EiE Nigeria) and her Kaduna State Partners - Legal Awareness for Nigerian Women (LANW) and Human Rights Monitor (HRM) was supported by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) Nigeria and The Nigerian Civil Society Situation Room.
A series of impactful town hall meetings were also conducted monthly in November and December 2023 across 10 Local Government Areas in two senatorial districts (Kaduna North and Kaduna Central) bringing together religious and traditional leaders, youth representatives, women leaders, persons with disability and Community Development Charter Champions; as part of our effort to promote citizen's engagement with the National Assembly members by equipping them with adequate information on ZIPs allocation for Kaduna State (ZIPs).



##  **KADUNA CENTRAL**
### **Chikun LGA**
The town hall meetings were held with a cumulative attendance of 27 persons. Salomi Dauda, the LGA Champion led the session by providing an overview of who legislators and executives are, their roles and the expectations of citizens towards these officials. Subsequent conversations were had about citizens not trusting their community leaders due to the assumption that personal gain is at play and the eventual apathy that arises from it. 
At the second meeting, a brief recap of the first meeting was given and afterward, the importance of citizens knowing and engaging elected representatives was stressed. The role of community leaders in demanding that the needs of their communities be met was also discussed. 
On a conclusive note, the participants urged that accountability projects like this should be taken seriously to help the LGA, especially because of the recurrent issues.

### **Igabi LGA**
The first and second town hall meeting was held at the Government Secondary School Rigasa and the Skills Acquisition Centre, Rigasa, respectively with a total of 101 persons in attendance. Comrade Sagir Umar, the Community Champion, set the stage by articulating the objectives of the meeting and further discussions were made about government structures and the importance of citizen engagement.
In an interactive session, participants voiced their concerns and shared insights into the specific challenges and aspirations of the community. The lively discussion touched upon crucial topics, including education and skills acquisition, security, and infrastructure. The exchange of ideas underscored the community's active engagement and commitment to addressing the pressing issues collaboratively.
At the second meeting, participants were educated on the roles of elected representatives and ZIPs endorsed and executed from 2020 to 2023. They were also encouraged to track these projects using the appropriate platforms and report their findings by the next meeting.

### **Kaduna North LGA** 
The town hall meetings were held at the Kabala Doki Palace with a total of 61 persons in attendance. Abdul Bako, the LGA Champion, outlined meeting objectives akin to those in Igabi. 
During the engaging session, participants were organized into wards, facilitating a focused discussion on the unique needs of each community. The collaborative efforts resulted in identifying pressing needs, ranging from crucial infrastructure projects like road construction and school development to specific healthcare improvements, including the expansion and interlocking of PHC Ungwa Rimi. 
At the second meeting, the citizensâ€™ knowledge of their representatives as well as the differences in the roles of the legislators and the local government heads was tested. The shine your eye portal was also shared with them for further engagement.
The meeting ended with a promise from the facilitator to the Champion that the list of ZIPs in Kaduna North would be sent to them.

### **Kaduna South LGA**
The town hall meetings were held at the Kaduna South Local Government Secretariat with a combined attendance of 86 persons. The Community Champion educated the citizens on the objectives of the project. At the end of the meeting, participants were able to better understand the impact of their legislators and the responsibilities the legislators have towards their constituency in particular.
At the second meeting, some elected officials across the LGA as well as members of Civil Society Organisations across the state.
A line of speakers drawn from various civil society organisations across the state spoke to participants about the issue of holding their democratically elected representatives accountable in the delivery of Zonal Intervention Projects (ZIPs). 
The meeting was concluded on the premise that there is a need for more sensitization at the lowest level, on the roles and responsibilities of legislators; hence the call for step-down training at community and ward levels by the community leaders.

### **Kajuru LGA**
The meetings were held at Kasuwan Magani, with a cumulative attendance of 33 persons. The Community Champion, Jonathan Peters stressed the need for stakeholders to take ownership by monitoring positive developments, particularly ZIPs facilitated by federal legislators. 
The representative of the Kufana traditional council also stated that monitoring projects like this should also go hand in hand with conflict sensitivity, as being a stakeholder means promoting and ensuring peace.
At the second meeting, conversations were had about legislative accountability and how important it is for community stakeholders to know more about the development projects in their communities and constituencies. Much emphasis was laid on the need for traditional leaders, the community development association, the religious stakeholders like the leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and Jamaatu Nasir Islam (JNI) within Kajuru LGA to work together as one people to drive development. 
Women's inclusion in every stage and process of advocacy was also discussed and a suggestion for the formation of a committee to track projects in each political ward in the LGA was provided. This suggestion was seconded and supported by more than 80% of those present in the meeting and an agreement was reached to find out more about the formation of the committee across various wards within the LGA.
