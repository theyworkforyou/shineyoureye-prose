There are three tiers of government in Nigeria – local, state, and federal governments.

**Local**
Local government is the third tier of government headed by an elected Chairman. Every local government has Local Government Council which comprises of Councillors. The Councillors are representing each ward in the local government. There are 774 local governments and 8,809 wards in Nigeria.

**State**
A state’s residents are represented by a [Governor](/position/executive-governors)and a [State House of Assembly](/position/state-representatives) member. The role of government at the state level, in collaboration with the local government, is to maintain primary, vocational and adult education and health services. State governments also share responsibility with the federal government to facilitate industrial, commercial and agricultural development, in addition to university and post-primary education matters.

**Federal**
The federal government is Nigeria’s highest establishment in charge of running the country. It is divided into three branches:

Executive
This branch consists of the President, Vice-President and Ministers of the Federation, which are subject to the provisions of laws made by National Assembly.

Judicial
The judicial branch upholds the mandates of the Constitution. This branch works via a court system.
