Local government is the third tier of government in Nigeria. It exists as a single tier across all states. Section 7(1) of the 1999 Constitution guarantees a system of local government run by democratically elected councils. The Constitution requires all states to enact legislation providing for the establishment, structure, composition, finance and functions of local government councils. The tenure of local council elected officials differ across states in Nigeria because it is determined by each state government. The state governments also have the power to determine when election local government elections are conducted.

Each of the states has enacted its own legislation. While core functions of local government are defined in the 4th Schedule of the Constitution, individual states may augment their responsibilities through legislation.
