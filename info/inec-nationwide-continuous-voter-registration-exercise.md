Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) is an exercise meant for the registration of citizens who turned 18 years of age after the last registration exercise; or those who for one reason or another could not register in the previous exercises.

1. INEC has said it will commence Continuous Voter's Registration across the country beginning from June 28th, 2021.
2. According to the head of ICT, Mrs. Wunmi Balogun, voter's enrolment devices will be used instead of the direct data capturing machine.
